# Snakes

#### Hello! :wave:
This is merely a game with studying purposes.
It's not even fun. Ha

I am fully aware that there are lots of bugs and I still plan on comming back to this to practice and improve.


##### List of bugs:
 - Being able to go back into the body of the snake by quickly tapping any direction then pressing the opposite button, although it shouldn't be possible.
 - Being able to move outside the screen if you input directions fast enough
